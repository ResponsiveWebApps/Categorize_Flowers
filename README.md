# Machine Learning: Categorize_Flowers
> Using machine learning with tensorflow to categorize flowers. 


Using a dataset from Google's documentation on Tensorflow. 

Creates a larger training set by augementating images by rotation, zoom and scaling. 

## Training and validation graphs

Initially used an epoch of 80. Discovered that an epoch of 100 had a more stable learning curve.
