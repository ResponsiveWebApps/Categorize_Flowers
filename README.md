# Flower_Categorize
> Using machine learning with tensorflow to categorize flowers.


Using a dataset from Google's documentation on Tensorflow. 

Creates a larger training set by augementating images by rotation, zoom and scaling. 

## Training and validation graphs

Initially used an epoch of 80. Discovered that an epoch of 100 had a more stable learning curve.   


## Development setup

The single file can be ran on Jupyter Notebook and Colab. 

```sh
Categorize_Flowers.ipynb
```
